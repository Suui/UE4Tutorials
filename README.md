# Unreal Engine 4 Tutorials
Hello! **Suui** here. Welcome to this repo!

##### What's this about?
I've decided to unite every tutorial I follow on Unreal Engine 4 in a single project as it is way more comfortable. Now, whenever I need a reference, there's only one place I need to check. 

When I decided to do this, I also thought it would be nice to make it public, as a possible resource for people who are also learning the Engine. It can also be a reference to check some tutorials that may be interesting, and being able to test out how the end result of the tutorial might be.

The tutorials I'll be following may be from the Official Video Tutorials, the Unreal Documentation, the wiki or any other tutorials that I find.

I'll be listing **here** every single tutorial I've completed, with a reference and a brief description.


## How to get the project
There are two ways of getting this project up and ready on your end. You may fork and clone this repository, and then download the Content, or you may want to download it entirely and forget about the repo.

#### · Download it all
1. Just download the full project from the following link (r1.0):  and get to the **Start it out!** section.

#### · Fork and Clone
1. Go ahead and fork the repo, then clone it to your computer.
2. Now download the Content from the following link (r1.0):
3. Once downloaded, navigate to your cloned repository folder. There shouldn't be any existing Content folder. There is no need to create it.
4. Extract the downloaded file directly in the cloned repository folder. That will create the entire Content folder for the project. Now **Start it out!**

#### · Start it out!
1. Yup! Now your project folder should be ready. Just open it from the **Launcher** or by double clicking the **UE4Tutorials.uproject** file.
2. After a brief (**maybe not that brief**) compilation and setup the Unreal Editor should be loading up.


## Project details
- **Release:** 1.0
- **UE4 ver:** 4.8.1
- This project was not built from the UE4 source code. It started out with the UE v4.7.6, from the Basic Code template.
The Content includes way more things than used. You may find the StarterContent, AnimStarterPack, some migrated stuff from the ContentExamples, and some more.

#### Project Organization
Inside the Content folder, you cand find the **Assets** folder, which contains all the non-tutorial specific Content. The other folders are each one in reference to a tutorial, or a related series of them. Inside those you will find everything that was created for the tutorial.
