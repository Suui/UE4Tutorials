I'm still not able to do this but I hope I'll get it done sometime before or during this summer (2015).
I'm  trying to figure out how I'm going to set up this as I have to get a lot of stuff into a single project, thinking about the assets and the size limits of GitHub.

# UE4Tutorials
I've decided to unite every tutorial I follow on Unreal Engine 4 in a single project as it is way more comfortable. This way, whenever I need a reference, there's only one place I need to check.

The tutorials I'll be following may be from the Official video tutorials, the Unreal Documentation, the wiki or any other tutorials that I find.

I'll try and write here every single tutorial I've completed, with a reference and a brief description.
