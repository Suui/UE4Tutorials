### Release 0.3
I've now figured out how to get the project and make it work easily. However I won't be setting up the project until release 1.0, when I'm done with some tutorials.


# UE4Tutorials
I've decided to unite every tutorial I follow on Unreal Engine 4 in a single project as it is way more comfortable. This way, whenever I need a reference, there's only one place I need to check.

The tutorials I'll be following may be from the Official video tutorials, the Unreal Documentation, the wiki or any other tutorials that I find.

I'll try and write here every single tutorial I've completed, with a reference and a brief description.
