### I'll be using this 0.1 release for testing purposes
Hello, I'm still trying to figure out the correct way to set up this project in your own PC. Once I figure it out, I'll write a little section about it. 0.1 release came out just because I'll be making some tests from it. Thank you.


# UE4Tutorials
I've decided to unite every tutorial I follow on Unreal Engine 4 in a single project as it is way more comfortable. This way, whenever I need a reference, there's only one place I need to check.

The tutorials I'll be following may be from the Official video tutorials, the Unreal Documentation, the wiki or any other tutorials that I find.

I'll try and write here every single tutorial I've completed, with a reference and a brief description.
