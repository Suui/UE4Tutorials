# Unreal Engine 4 Tutorials
I've decided to unite every tutorial I follow on Unreal Engine 4 in a single project as it is way more comfortable. Now, whenever I need a reference, there's only one place I need to check. 

When I decided to do this, I also thought it would be nice to make it public, as a possible resource for people who are also learning the Engine. It can also be a reference to check some tutorials that may be interesting, and being able to test out how the end result of the tutorial might be.

The tutorials I'll be following may be from the Official Video Tutorials, the Unreal Documentation, the wiki or any other tutorials that I find.

I'll be listing here every single tutorial I've completed, with a reference and a brief description.


## How to get the project
There are two ways of getting this project up and ready on your end. You may fork and clone this repository, and then download the Content, or you may want to download it entirely and forget about the repo.

#### Fork and Clone
1. Go ahead and fork the repo, then clone it in your computer.
2. Now just download the Content from the following link:
3. Once downloaded, navigate to your cloned repository folder. There shouldn't be any existing Content folder. There is no need to create it.
4. Extract the downloaded file directly in the cloned repository folder. That will create the entire Content folder for the project.
5. Now your project folder should be ready. Just open it from the launcher or by double clicking in the .uproject file.
6. After a brief (**maybe not that brief**) compilation and setup the Unreal Editor should be loading up.
