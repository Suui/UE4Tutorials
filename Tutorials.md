# Tutorials

Here follows a list (in alphabetical order) of the tutorials that have been completed and included in this project.

**Note:** I've completed far more tutorials, but before making them into a single project. I hope to find some time to merge them into this project. Also, as of release 1.0 there are only C++ tutorials, I want to include the ones non-code related too. However after the r1.0 I won't be able to work on this for an entire month or so, sorry. After that, back on it!

## Completed Tutorials List

#### Learning C++ by Creating Games with Unreal Engine 4 (LCPP)
- **About:** This is an entire book written by William Serif. It has about 315 pages in which he covers learning C++ and then he applies it with UE4. Really nice for non-programmers who want to get into coding, or for programmers who want to switch to C++. The UE4 version that is used in the books is the v4.5, however I've updated the code to work with the current UE4 version.
- **Covers:** Learning C++, UE4 C++, Character, Enemy Mobs, Inventory, Melee Attacking, Spells. Little of how to make a level, a basic UI and Particles are also mentioned.
- **Notes:** You may find the code largely modified sometimes. I don't really like the coding design used in the book, but tried to stay faithful to it when I could.

#### Unreal Engine 4 Programming Guide (PG)
##### 1. Programming Quick Start
- **About**: This tutorial will take you through the steps for creating a UE4 C++ project, add code to it, compile it, and basically a first step into C++ programming in UE4.
- **Covers:** Create project, Add code to it, Compile it, Actors
- **Notes:** The On Your Own! part is completed (by Suui).

##### 2. Introduction to C++ Programming in UE4
- **About:** A nice and long article about more in-depth UE4 C++ programming. You'll also be creating a simple actor.
- **Covers:** UE4 C++ programming theory (a lot), Actors
- **Notes:** It may be really hard to catch if you are new to programming, but the first part is still worth it. For more experienced programmers, be sure to check it out until the end, Engine structure, Specifiers, Garbage Collection...
