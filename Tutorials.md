# Tutorials

Here follows a list (in alphabetical order) of the tutorials that have been completed and included in this project.

**Note:** I've completed far more tutorials, but before making them into a single project. I hope to find some time to merge them into this project. Also, as of release 1.0 there are only C++ tutorials, I want to include the ones non-code related too. However after the r1.0 I won't be able to work on this for an entire month or so, sorry. After that, back on it!

##### Tutorial Title
Folder name: **FolderName**, abbreviation: **ABR**.
- **About:** A description of what to expect from the tutorial.
- **Covers:** This, That, Stuff. Little of Something.
- **Notes:** Things that should be noticed about the completed tutorial.

## Completed Tutorials List

#### Learning C++ by Creating Games with Unreal Engine 4
Folder name: **LearningCPP**, abbreviation: **LCPP**.
- **About:** This is an entire book written by William Serif. It has about 315 pages in which he covers learning C++ and then he applies it with UE4. Really nice for non-programmers who want to get into coding, or for programmers who want to switch to C++. The UE4 version that is used in the books is the v4.5, however I've updated the code to work with the current UE4 version.
- **Covers:** Learning C++, UE4 C++, Character, Enemy Mobs, Inventory, Melee Attacking, Spells. Little of how to make a level, a basic UI and Particles are also mentioned.
- **Notes:** You may find the code largely modified sometimes. I don't really like the coding design used in the book, but tried to stay faithful to it when I could.

#### Unreal Engine 4 Programming Guide
Folder name: **UE4ProgrammingGuide**, abbreviation: **PG**.

##### 1. Programming Quick Start
- **About**: This tutorial will take you through the steps for creating a UE4 C++ project, add code to it, compile it, and basically a first step into C++ programming in UE4.
- **Covers:** Create project, Add code to it, Compile it, Actors
- **Notes:** The On Your Own! part is completed.
- **Source:** [UE4 Documentation link.](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/QuickStart/index.html)

##### 2. Introduction to C++ Programming in UE4
- **About:** A nice and long article about more in-depth UE4 C++ programming. You'll also be creating a simple actor.
- **Covers:** UE4 C++ programming theory (a lot), Actors
- **Notes:** It may be really hard to catch if you are new to programming, but the first part is still worth it. For more experienced programmers, be sure to check it out until the end, Engine structure, Specifiers, Garbage Collection...

##### 3. Player Input and Pawns
- **About:** Nice as an introduction to Pawn programming, Pawns can be possessed by the player and react to input. You'll check it out in a simple way over the tutorial.
- **Covers:** Pawns, Input
- **Notes:** The On Your Own! part is completed.
- **Source:** [UE4 Documentation link.](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Tutorials/PlayerInput/index.html)

##### 4. Game-Controlled Cameras
- **About:** Well, Cameras! Static ones. You'll be placing some cameras in the world and blending between them.
- **Covers:** Cameras (static)
- **Notes:** The On Your Own! part is completed.
- **Source:** [UE4 Documentation link.](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Tutorials/AutoCamera/index.html)

##### 5. Variables, Timers and Events
- **About:** Title says it all, creating timers, clearing them and combining the function calls between C++ and Blueprints.
- **Covers:** Timers, Actors.
- **Notes:** The On Your Own! part is partly completed. The torch part was a bit freestyle, making use of the Tick function instead of Timers.
- **Source:** [UE4 Documentation link.](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Tutorials/VariablesTimersEvents/index.html)

##### 6. Player-Controlled Cameras
- **About:** Attaching a camera to a Pawn so that it follows it (something like 3rd person games). It introduces you to some camera properties. The Pawn will be reacting to the user Input and moving around.
- **Covers:** Pawns, Input, Cameras
- **Notes:** The On Your Own! part is partly completed. The points 2 and 5 were skipped. The periodic motion was implemented with a curve that you can find and edit in the tutorial folder.

##### 7. Components and Collision
- **About:** Really interesting tutorial on how to create your own C++ components. Over the tutorial, you'll get together a Pawn with your own Movement Component, a basic Camera and some Input. Plus Fire! The collision part just covers a Collision Sphere component for your sphere-shaped Pawn.
- **Covers:** Components, Pawns, Input. Little for Collision.
- **Notes:** The On Your Own! part is partly completed, just the 1st point.
